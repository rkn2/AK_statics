"Static equilibrium in Remote Alaska" is a comprehensive educational module focused on teaching static equilibrium and physics through a combination of theory, practical examples, and computational exercises. This module integrates physics concepts with Python programming, enabling students to solve real-world problems such as calculating the load-bearing capacity of ice and designing structures like bridges in specific environmental contexts. The presented material here serves as a public version of the broader impacts from [this National Science Foundation grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2121909&HistoricalAwards=false). 

## Course Content:

| Lesson | Content Summary                 | Google CoLab|
|------|---------------------------------|------|
| 1    | This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of statics, focusing on the principles of forces in equilibrium. It provides an understanding of how to solve problems involving force vectors, both through graphical and analytical methods. The lesson emphasizes the importance of understanding the conditions for equilibrium in various physical scenarios, and it guides students in applying these principles to practical, real-world problems. | [![Unit_01](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dp6GRQZdSIWkXo8C7EeEGafog3wipmi3?usp=sharing) |
| 2    | The lesson covers concepts like support forces and net force, and teaches students how to apply the principles of vertical and horizontal equilibrium.

## Additional resources for teachers
The document "Code_Outlines.ipynb" is a guide for teachers on translating physics problems into code outlines, aimed at high school students. It emphasizes the importance of creating "code outlines" or "code scaffolds" to guide students through computational problem-solving in physics. The document details the components of a code outline, including problem understanding, variable assignments, calculations, and print statements. It walks through examples like calculating the maximum height of a projectile and the horizontal range of a launched projectile, demonstrating how to define problems, set variables, outline calculations, and display results. This approach helps students organize their thoughts and understand the logic of programming in the context of physics.

The document "interacting_colab.ipynb" is a guide for teachers and students on how to interact with colab notebooks. This material was produced by Google and has been reproduced for simplicity. These resources were only curated and were not written by the authors of this work. 

## Dependencies and Installation
This project uses the Python programming language, and requires Python >= 3.9.
Units are written and available as CoLab notebooks. 

## Getting started with the material
The course "Static Equilibrium in Remote Alaska" is designed primarily for first-year high school Physics students. However, it's also accessible to a wider audience for self-study or as a resource for other instructors to adapt and build upon. We provide a summary on how to engage with the material effectively for both individual learners and educators.

### Using the material as a student for self-study
For students using the material independently for self-study, simply progress through each notebook in sequence. The most straightforward approach is to use the provided Colab links, which are set up to function immediately with all necessary packages. Should you encounter any issues, often restarting the runtime environment in Colab can resolve them.

### Using the material as an educator
Instructors can flexibly utilize the course material in their teaching. Feel free to modify and adapt any part of the content to suit your teaching needs. Sharing your experiences with using the material is greatly appreciated. The most straightforward approach is to use the provided Colab links, which are set up to function immediately with all necessary packages. Should you encounter any issues, often restarting the runtime environment in Colab can resolve them.
