# AK_statics


"Static equilibrium in Remote Alaska" is a comprehensive educational module focused on teaching static equilibrium and physics through a combination of theory, practical examples, and computational exercises. This module integrates physics concepts with Python programming, enabling students to solve real-world problems such as calculating the load-bearing capacity of ice and designing structures like bridges in specific environmental contexts. The presented material here serves as a public version of the broader impacts from this grant: xxx.

The document "Code_Outlines.ipynb" is a guide for teachers on translating physics problems into code outlines, aimed at high school students. It emphasizes the importance of creating "code outlines" or "code scaffolds" to guide students through computational problem-solving in physics. The document details the components of a code outline, including problem understanding, variable assignments, calculations, and print statements. It walks through examples like calculating the maximum height of a projectile and the horizontal range of a launched projectile, demonstrating how to define problems, set variables, outline calculations, and display results. This approach helps students organize their thoughts and understand the logic of programming in the context of physics.
