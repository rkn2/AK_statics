# Statement of Need
## Contextualized STEM Content
The benefits of contextualized science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching are well known. "Contextualized Modules in Physics for Junior High School Students" by Marzan indicated that contextualized modules in physics enabled students to outperform the traditional lecture group in post-test evaluations [@marzan2018contextualized]. Similar results were seen by Cid in "Contextualized magnetism in secondary school: learning from the LHC (CERN)" [@cid2005contextualized]. That article discussed the introduction of simple physical calculations related to magnetic phenomena in old accelerators and the Large Hadron Collider. They discussed how these calculations can be used in classrooms to spark students' curiosity, aid their understanding of physical concepts, and illustrate the connection between theoretical physics ("cold equations") and the dynamic world of scientific research.
Furthering the discussion about contextualized education, Cech's article in Nature, titled "Education: Embed social awareness in science curricula," emphasizes the need for a more integrated approach to teaching socially responsible students science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in general [@cech2014education]. The study conducted by Cech showed that engineering students often leave university less interested in public welfare than when they started, which is contrary to what should be happening. The article suggests that STEM education should incorporate social issues throughout its curricula, not just in separate ethics courses. This is based on the premise that STEM practitioners who understand the role of their profession in society are better equipped to solve real-world problems. The article concludes that addressing public-welfare concerns should be a fundamental part of STEM education, suggesting that even a small proportion of homework and exam questions focusing on the social implications of scientific work could help reverse the trend of disengagement from these crucial issues. This approach is vital for producing well-rounded professionals capable of addressing the complex challenges of our time. 

Cech was not alone in this sentiment and the idea has been echoed in works such as "The people part of engineering: Engineering for, with, and as people" by Fila et al [@fila2014people]. 
This was also seen in "History of Science in Physics Teaching Possibilities for Contextualized Teaching?" by Jardim et al which discusses the use of a historical approach in science education, particularly in physics, to provide a more contextualized understanding of the development of scientific knowledge [@jardim2021history]. The primary aim is to explore how lessons incorporating a Cultural History of Science approach can enable activities that encourage students to consider their socio-cultural context, with a specific reference to Brazilian scientific production. It also investigates how students can develop a deeper understanding of scientific practices through classroom discussions inspired by this approach, focusing on both historical contexts and students' own social environments. The approach allows students to recognize that science is developed by various social actors, in different settings beyond the laboratory and involves diverse actions. The findings suggest that this method of teaching science is effective in historically contextualizing science development while also enabling students to reflect on scientific production within their social context.
Furthermore, this was discussed in the context of high school education in Upegui et al's , "Integration of the Topic of Social Justice into High School Biology Curricula" [@upegui2022integration]. That study found that this more contextualized approach not only enhances students' understanding of STEM concepts but also prepares them for comprehensive participation in society by making them aware of and sensitive to social inequities.


## Examining our case study

In rural Alaska, the importance of contextualizing STEM decisions with social considerations is a clear need. Pathways are vital between remote communities to essential services, traditional hunting grounds, and educational facilities. These pathways, often dependent on frozen rivers and lakes during the colder months, have been the lifeblood of subsistence farming, hunting, and gathering traditions for generations. However, as the impacts of climate change intensify, the once reliable pathways face a series of unprecedented challenges that threaten to unravel the fabric of community life. Rising temperatures lead to delayed freezing and early thawing of rivers and lakes, resulting in thinner, less predictable ice. What was once a reliable and sturdy path across frozen rivers and lakes has become increasingly treacherous, posing significant dangers to those relying on these natural highways. Remote communities now grapple with the uncertainty of if and when their vital connections will be safe to traverse. As climate change disrupts the delicate balance of Alaskaâ€™s ecosystem, storms have also grown in frequency and intensity. The once-familiar natural rhythm of seasonal changes has been upended, leaving communities vulnerable to unpredictable weather patterns. Fierce winds, heavy precipitation, and intense storms wreak havoc on the pathways, jeopardizing mobility and making travel arduous and dangerous. 

In response to these challenges, building bridges has emerged as a promising solution to ensure reliable connections between remote communities. Bridges can offer year-round access, providing a lifeline during the warming months when traditional pathways are impassable in winter. The benefits of bridges are apparent, enabling greater access to essential services, healthcare facilities, and educational opportunities. They can foster economic growth by facilitating trade and commerce, uplifting these communities through improved connectivity. While building bridges can bring numerous benefits to remote communities, some drawbacks can significantly impact local culture and subsistence farming lifestyles. These drawbacks stem from changes in access, mobility, and cultural dynamics that can alter the traditional way of life in these communities. In this perspective piece, we shed light on the intricate relationship between social science and engineering challenges faced in building and maintaining bridges in remote Alaska. The course highlights the social, cultural, and ecological challenges of Alaska, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This comprehensive approach ensures students are not only academically prepared but also socially and environmentally aware, addressing the urgent need for interdisciplinary education in today's rapidly changing world.

The community of Aleknagik (pop. 197) is located on both the north and south shores at the outlet of Aleknagik Lake where it flows into the Wood River [@us_census_bureau_2010]. Residents of Aleknagik are predominantly Alaska Native (91%) and are Yupâ€™ik-speaking peoples called the Kiatagmiut, whose traditional territory included the Nushagak River drainage to the east into the Wood River lakes, including Aleknagik Lake [@veltre1996paugvik]. A school was established in 1933 that brought together several communities to the present location. In 1959, a road was constructed to connect the south shore with the regional hub of Dillingham. The road was upgraded in the 1980s and paved in the mid-2000s.The Wood River Bridge was constructed in 2015, connecting the two sides of the community. Until then, the north shore, where the school as well as city and tribal government offices are located, was accessible only via boat in the summer or snow machine in the winter, or via small aircraft that can land on the state-maintained runway [@holen2012subsistence]. The bridge now allows frequent travel to Dillingham (pop. 2,226), a regional hub and one of two main harbors for the Bristol Bay fishery, the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world [@alaska_dept_labor_2021]. Dillingham has a paved runway that can handle large jet aircraft, and it has two grocery stores, a bulk food store, a bank, a middle and high school, the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Bristol Bay campus, a hospital, and other services provided by a small city [@alaska_dfg_2010].

The Wood River Bridge was a long-sought infrastructure project. Studies for the bridge began in the early 2000s after an earmark from Senator Ted Stevens. Two longtime state legislators from the region, Rep. Bryce Edgmon of Dillingham and Sen. Lyman Hoffman of Bethel, pushed the project forward with local support that led to an appropriation from the Alaska Legislature of $20 million in 2008. A long line of mayors from Aleknagik kept the bridge momentum going with legislative support as well as support from AKDOT [@bendinger_dischner_2021]. The Wood River Bridge was a successful project with broad support. In order to understand the impacts of the Wood River Bridge on the wellbeing of Aleknagik residents, we conducted both questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews from 2022 to 2024. The results suggest that the bridge has reduced travel fatalities across the river substantially; has improved accessibility to shopping, healthcare, education, and hunting on the south side of the lake; and has increased social interactions between the two sides of Aleknagik. The residents, however, are also concerned with the growing number of tourists and with people from outside of the village more easily accessing  their natural resources (e.g., berry picking and salmon fishing).

## Experience of Use
The high school physics teacher who implemented this curriculum expressed a positive and engaging experience with the course material. According to her comments, students were actively engaged as they worked through the background information on the challenges faced by Alaska's remote communities and followed along with the Python code. They particularly appreciated the practical application of the curriculum, where they explored how the thickness of ice impacts its load-bearing capacity. The students also weighed in on their experience with the curriculum. They found the walkthrough on writing and running the code to be very detailed, however they believed the information could be condensed for members with some prior background in Python. In conversations with the high school teacher, it was discussed to leave the curriculum in its current form but to encourage those who might use it to critically evaluate the level of coding experience in their students and potentially provide two versions, one with all the python explanation and one without for those who already have a coding background. Overall the students were enthusiastic about the curriculum's ability to bridge the gap between coding skills and real-life applications; the high school teacher found that this curriculum successfully fostered a meaningful connection between programming, physics, and real-world challenges.
