# Summary

This course intertwines physics education with the unique challenges faced by Alaska's remote communities. It begins with fundamental statics concepts, emphasizing forces in equilibrium and vector problem-solving. Progressing through equilibrium in structures and torque, it culminates in practical applications like bridge construction in Alaska. The course, aimed at first-year high school students, introduces Python programming for physics applications. It's structured for in-person and self-guided learning on CoLab. The Alaska context adds depth, exploring social, ecological, and engineering challenges in these communities, emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration for sustainable solutions.

This course module, designed for first-year high school students with no prior knowledge of static equilibrium and programmatic data analysis, serves as an introductory bridge to programming through high school physics. It is structured as a multi-week course that introduces Python programming and its application in physics. The module comprises five units tailored for an in-person learning environment, featuring live coding sessions and explanations, followed by independent or pair coding activities. Hosted on CoLab, it supports both self-guided and classroom-based learning, extending educational opportunities beyond the traditional classroom setting.

# Statement of Need
