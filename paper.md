# Summary

The course begins with an introduction to statics, delving into forces in equilibrium and vector-based problem-solving. The subsequent lessons explore the principles of equilibrium in structures, emphasizing the balance of forces both vertically and horizontally. The course then transitions to torque and rotational equilibrium, teaching both theoretical and practical aspects. Force analysis on single-plane structures is also covered, culminating in a detailed study of static equilibrium in bridge structures, where concepts like shear forces and environmental impacts are discussed. Additionally, students are encouraged to critically evaluate engineering decisions in light of social, ecological, and other context. 

This course module, designed for first-year high school students with no prior knowledge of static equilibrium and programmatic data analysis, serves as an introductory bridge to programming through high school physics. It is structured as a multi-week course that introduces Python programming and its application in physics. The module comprises five units tailored for an in-person learning environment, featuring live coding sessions and explanations, followed by independent or pair coding activities. Hosted on CoLab, it supports both self-guided and classroom-based learning, extending educational opportunities beyond the traditional classroom setting.
